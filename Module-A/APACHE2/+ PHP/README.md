# APACHE 2 + PHP

### Step 1: Install PHP

- Ensure that PHP is installed on your Apache2 server. You can install PHP by running the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install php
```

### Step 2: Configure Apache2 to process PHP files

- By default, Apache2 may not be configured to process PHP files. You need to enable the ``php`` module in Apache2. Run the following command to enable the module:

```
sudo a2enmod php
```

### Step 3: Configure Apache2 to handle ``.php`` files

- Edit the Apache2 configuration file for your domain (e.g., ``mydomain.conf``) or the default configuration file (``/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf``). Add or modify the following lines inside the ``<VirtualHost>`` block:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    # Add the following lines to handle PHP files
    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

- Save the configuration file and exit the text editor.

### Step 4: Create a ``phpinfo.php`` file

- In the Apache2 DocumentRoot directory (``/var/www/html`` by default), create a new file named ``phpinfo.php``:

```
sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

- Inside the file, add the following line:

```
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```

- Save the file and exit the text editor.

### Step 5: Set appropriate file permissions

- Ensure that the file has appropriate read permissions. In most cases, the default permissions are sufficient. You can use the following command to ensure the file has the correct permissions:

```
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

### Step 6: Restart Apache2

- Restart Apache2 to apply the changes:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### Step 7: Test ``phpinfo()``

- Open a web browser and enter your domain name followed by ``/phpinfo.php`` (e.g., ``http://yourdomain.com/phpinfo.php``). You should see the PHP information page generated by ``phpinfo()``. It provides details about your PHP installation and configuration.
