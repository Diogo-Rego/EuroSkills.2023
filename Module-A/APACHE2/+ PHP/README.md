### Step 1: Install PHP

- Ensure that PHP is installed on your Apache2 server. You can install PHP by running the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php
```

### Step 2: Create a ``phpinfo.php`` file

- In the Apache2 DocumentRoot directory (``/var/www/html`` by default), create a new file named ``phpinfo.php``:

```
sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

- Inside the file, add the following line:

```
<?php phpinfo();?>
```

- Save the file and exit the text editor.

### Step 5: Set appropriate file permissions

- Ensure that the file has appropriate read permissions. In most cases, the default permissions are sufficient. You can use the following command to ensure the file has the correct permissions:

```
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

### Step 6: Restart Apache2

- Restart Apache2 to apply the changes:

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### Step 7: Test ``phpinfo()``

- Open a web browser and enter your domain name followed by ``/phpinfo.php`` (e.g., ``http://yourdomain.com/phpinfo.php``). You should see the PHP information page generated by ``phpinfo()``. It provides details about your PHP installation and configuration.
