### Step 1: Install the OpenSSH Server

Open a terminal on your Debian machine and use the following command to install the OpenSSH server:

````
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
````

This will download and install the OpenSSH server on your system.

### Step 2: Configure Root Password Access

- Open the SSH server configuration file in a text editor:

````
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
````

- Look for the line that says:

````
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
````

- Change it to:

````
PermitRootLogin yes
````

- Save the file and exit the text editor.

### Step 3: Restart the SSH Server:

After making the changes to the SSH configuration, you need to restart the SSH server for the changes to take effect:

````
sudo systemctl restart sshd
````

OR

````
sudo service sshd restart
````
