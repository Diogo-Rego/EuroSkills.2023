### missing the part where only the webmaste can enter the ftp server


# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf

# The default compiled-in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file
# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled-in defaults.

# Run standalone? vsftpd can run either from an inetd or as a standalone
# daemon started from an initscript.
listen=YES

# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. By default, listening
# on the IPv6 "any" address (::) will accept connections from both IPv6
# and IPv4 clients. It is not necessary to listen on *both* IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets. If you want that (perhaps because you want to listen on specific
# addresses) then you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration
# files.
# listen_ipv6=YES

# Allow anonymous FTP? (Disabled by default).

# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)

# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only
# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.
# anon_upload_enable=YES

# Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create
# new directories.
# anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES

# Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they
# go into a certain directory.

# If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time
# in your local time zone. The default is to display GMT. The
# times returned by the MDTM FTP command are also affected by this
# option.
